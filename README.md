ABSTRACT = {Automatic meter infrastructure (AMI) systems using remote metering are being widely used to utilize water resources efficiently and minimize non-revenue water. We propose a convolutional neural network-long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM)-based solution that can predict faulty remote water meter reading (RWMR) devices by analyzing approximately 2,850,000 AMI data collected from 2762 customers over 360 days in a small-sized city in South Korea. The AMI data used in this study is a challenging, highly unbalanced real-world dataset with limited features. First, we perform extensive preprocessing steps and extract meaningful features for handling this challenging dataset with limited features. Next, we select important features that have a higher influence on the classifier using a recursive feature elimination method. Finally, we apply the CNN-LSTM model for predicting faulty RWMR devices. We also propose an efficient training method for ML models to learn the unbalanced real-world AMI dataset. A cost-effective threshold for evaluating the performance of ML models is proposed by considering the mispredictions of ML models as well as the cost. Our experimental results show that an F-measure of 0.82 and MCC of 0.83 are obtained when the CNN-LSTM model is used for prediction.},
